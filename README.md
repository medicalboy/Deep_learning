# STAT3007Project
All the models + testing code is contained in Model_and_testing.ipynb.
There are some python pickle files in this directory which can be used to avoid having to run some of the slower parts of the Model_and_testing notebook.
The main dataset is in csv_files/cricsheet_data.csv.
Some other miscellaneous helper scripts and notebooks are included in this directory.
